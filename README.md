# Minimizing Rust Binary Size

This repository demonstrates how to minimize the size of a Rust binary.

By default, Rust optimizes for execution speed rather than binary size, since for the vast
majority of applications this is ideal. But for situations where a developer wants to optimize
for binary size instead, Rust provides mechanisms to accomplish this.
